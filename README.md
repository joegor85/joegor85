I am currently immersed in an 18-week Software Engineering learning  
environment by Galvanize Inc. I am creating many cool projects as I  
continue to learn and develop my software skills. Check out some of my latest projects!

#### My first project utilizing the React framework. I am a list-maker, so I decided to make a list manager to help users keep track of lists in daily life.
